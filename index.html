    <div id="t"><p>I am a rising sophomore at Stuyvesant High School, outside of school I take part in multiple code learning programs such as All Star Code. I aspire to work in the tech industry and want to show that through my displayed projects on this website. My ambitions and drive come from my parents and sister who always worked hard for my sake and still work even harder now. I have learned how to code in both python and javascript and also know how to develope websites such as this one. I am still learning and am always progressing with each day to get closer to my goals. </p>
